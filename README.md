# Some stuff to read.

So, first of all, I have to tell that this project is *NOT* supposed to be downloaded and then `ng serve` and stuff.
It's just basic quick example of my current code (Angular + TypeScript), which includes just one Component and one Service.
I took it from my current project and changed all function's names and even most of content because I do not have any rights to share real code (It's private and so on...).
So, it's just an overview, that should show how I write code and so forth.
I believe I've made myself clear.
