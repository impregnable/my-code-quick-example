# Some significant stuff to read.

So, first of all, I have to tell that this project is *NOT* supposed to be downloaded and then `ng serve` and stuff. It doesn't even contains html along with component.    
It's just basic quick example of my current code (Angular + TypeScript), which includes just Component, Service and Class (one each).    
I took it from my current project and changed all function's names and even most of content, made it simple and short. Because I do not have any rights to share real production code (It's private and so on...).  
So, it's just an overview, that should show you how I write code and so forth.  
I believe I've made myself clear.
